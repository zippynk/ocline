# ocline
A simple line-based text reader and editor for the command line. Inspired by what I've heard GNU Ed is like. Except I've never used GNU Ed. I just know it doesn't act like this.

OCLine is a work in progress. Pull requests are encouraged, but won't necessarily be accepted. Keeping stuff under the MPL won't hurt your chances (a.k.a if you're going to PR, please keep stuff under the MPL).
